## Project Intro/Objective
The main purpose of this project is to use data science methods and create machine learning models to analyze and predict stomach cancer mortality rates across different U.S. counties, considering various factors such as race, age, and county. The aim is to identify patterns and contributing factors, including social determinants of health (SDOH) and other health metrics, to better understand and address disparities in cancer outcomes. The aim is to contribute to reducing stomach cancer mortality rates in the U.S., providing important insights for public health officials, policymakers, and healthcare providers.

## Project Description
This project involves a detailed county-level analysis of stomach cancer mortality rates, using data from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) combined with additional datasets such as SDOH and detailed county-level health measures. The dataset includes numerous variables, providing a comprehensive view of the factors influencing mortality rates. Key questions and hypotheses explored include the influence of demographic and socioeconomic factors on stomach cancer outcomes and the effectiveness of machine learning models in predicting these rates.
